## Hey there! Welcome to my profile! 🙂

### Who am I? 🤔

My name is [Thiago](https://prei.work). I'm a 20 y.o. Computer Science Student at the University of São Paulo (USP) in São Carlos.

### What do I do? 👷

I am very passionate about toy projects. 
If I get a chance of creating some silly tool that will automate my life, I'll take it. So I have had many projects in the past (many of them had no future)

Right now I'm mostly working in making a [platform](https://github.com/Projeto-USPY/) for USP students to seek information about professors and subjects.

I've done a lot of Freelancing @ Upwork and I'm currently a Backend Developer Intern @ iFood 🌮

### What are my main programming languages? 🖥️

- I like **Python** 🐍 for making proof of concepts, quick scripting and webscraping.
- I like **Go** 🐹 because its very practical to make web servers, microservices and CLIs.
- I like **C++**  for solving Algorithms and Data Structures problems 😛
