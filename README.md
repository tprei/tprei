## Hey there! Welcome to my profile! 🙂

### Who am I? 🤔

My name is [Thiago](https://prei.work). I'm a 21 y.o. Computer Science Student at the University of São Paulo (USP) in São Carlos.

### What do I do? 👷

I am very passionate about toy projects. 
If I get a chance of creating some silly tool that will automate my life, I'll take it. So I have had many projects in the past (many of them had no future but I have learned a lot!)

Right now I'm mostly working on making an awesome [platform](https://github.com/Projeto-USPY/) for USP students to seek information about professors and subjects.

I've done a lot of Freelancing @ Upwork and I'm currently a Software Developer @ iFood 🌮, the largest food delivery platform in South America

### What are my main tools? 🖥️

- I like **Python** 🐍 for making proof of concepts, quick scripting and webscraping.
- I like **Go** 🐹 because of its parallel programming patterns and for making microservices and web servers.
- I like **C++**  for solving Algorithms and Data Structures problems 😛
- I also have some experience with GCP, AWS, Docker, GitHub Automation (CI/CD), SQL and other things!

**Right now**: Currently learning more about the JS/TS ecosystem to try and become a versatile developer!
